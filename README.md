## Components

### Navbar

### Splash

#### Static background image

The background image in the splash section can be changed in `js/main.js`. Simply change the contents of the variable `backgroundImage` from `"img/bg3.jpg"` to the image of your choice:

```js
// static background image

var backgroundImage = "img/bg3.jpg";

$("#splash").backstretch(backgroundImage);
```

#### Cycle between background images

To have the splash section cycle between multiple background images, comment out the single background image code, and uncomment the multiple background image code. Simply change the contents of the array `backgroundImages` to include whatever images you want to cycle between.

```js
// cycle between background images

var backgroundImages = ["img/bg3.jpg", "img/portfolio1.jpg", "img/portfolio2.jpg"];
var cyclingDuration = 5000;  // duration between transitions, in milliseconds
var cyclingFade = 1000;  // duration of fade effect, in milliseconds

$("#splash").backstretch(backgroundImages,
  {
    duration: cyclingDuration,
    fade: cyclingFade
  }
);
```
